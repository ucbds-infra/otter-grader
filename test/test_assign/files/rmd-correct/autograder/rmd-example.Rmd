# Otter Assign for Rmd

```{r}
library(testthat)
library(ggplot2)
rng_seed <- 42
```

**Question 1.** Assign x to the smallest prime number.

```{r tags=c("otter_assign_solution_cell")}
x <- 2 # SOLUTION
```

```{r}
. = ottr::check("tests/q1.R")
```

**Question 2.** Visualize the answer

```{r tags=c("otter_assign_solution_cell")}
set.seed(123) # SEED
# BEGIN SOLUTION NO PROMPT
x <- runif(100)
y <- rnorm(100)
data <- data.frame(x, y)
ggplot(data, aes(x=x, y=y)) +
    geom_point()
# END SOLUTION
. = " # BEGIN PROMPT
plt.plot(...);
"; # END PROMPT
```

This cell is not part of a question.

```{r}
y <- 3
```

**Question 3.** Define `square` and assign `nine` to 3 squared.

```{r tags=c("otter_assign_solution_cell")}
square <- function(x) {
    y <- x * x # SOLUTION
    return(y) # SOLUTION
}

nine <- square(3) # SOLUTION
```

```{r}
. = ottr::check("tests/q3.R")
```

**Question 4.** What does equilateral mean?


_Type your answer here, replacing this text._

<!-- #region tags=["otter_assign_solution_cell"] -->
Having equal side lengths.
<!-- #endregion -->

```{r}
# this isn't part of a question
# it's here to make sure that we get a MD cell above to close the export
# of question 4
```

**Question 5.** Approximate the area and circumference of a circle with radius 3.

```{r tags=c("otter_assign_solution_cell")}
pi <- 3.14
if (TRUE) {
    # BEGIN SOLUTION
    radius = 3
    area = radius * pi * pi
    # END SOLUTION
    print(paste0('A circle with radius', radius, 'has area', area))
}

circumference <- function(r) {
    # BEGIN SOLUTION NO PROMPT
    return(2 * pi * r)
    # END SOLUTION
    " # BEGIN PROMPT
    # Next, define a circumference function.
    "; # END PROMPT
}
```

```{r}
# This question has no tests.
```

**Question 6.** Write something

_This question has a custom prompt below, so that prompt should be in the output. It also has no solution!_

_Write your thing here._


**Question 7:** What is the answer?


_Type your answer here, replacing this text._

<!-- #region tags=["otter_assign_solution_cell"] -->
42
<!-- #endregion -->

**Question 8:** Test intercell seeding by generating 10 random $N(4,2)$ numbers.

```{r tags=c("otter_assign_solution_cell")}
set.seed(42) # SEED
z <- rnorm(10, 4, 2) # SOLUTION
z
```

```{r}
. = ottr::check("tests/q8.R")
```

**You're done!**


## Submission

Make sure you have run all cells in your notebook in order before running the cell below, so that all images/graphs appear in the output. The cell below will generate a zip file for you to submit. **Please save before exporting!**

```{r}
# Save your notebook first, then run this cell to export your submission.
ottr::export("rmd-example.Rmd", pdf = TRUE)
```
