# Otter Assign for Rmd

```{r}
library(testthat)
library(ggplot2)
rng_seed <- 90
```

**Question 1.** Assign x to the smallest prime number.

```{r tags=c()}
x <- NULL # YOUR CODE HERE
```

```{r}
. = ottr::check("tests/q1.R")
```

**Question 2.** Visualize the answer

```{r tags=c()}
plt.plot(...);
```

This cell is not part of a question.

```{r}
y <- 3
```

**Question 3.** Define `square` and assign `nine` to 3 squared.

```{r tags=c()}
square <- function(x) {
    y <- NULL # YOUR CODE HERE
    # YOUR CODE HERE
}

nine <- NULL # YOUR CODE HERE
```

```{r}
. = ottr::check("tests/q3.R")
```

**Question 4.** What does equilateral mean?

_Type your answer here, replacing this text._

```{r}
# this isn't part of a question
# it's here to make sure that we get a MD cell above to close the export
# of question 4
```

**Question 5.** Approximate the area and circumference of a circle with radius 3.

```{r tags=c()}
pi <- 3.14
if (TRUE) {
    # YOUR CODE HERE
    print(paste0('A circle with radius', radius, 'has area', area))
}

circumference <- function(r) {
    # Next, define a circumference function.
}
```

```{r}
# This question has no tests.
```

**Question 6.** Write something

_This question has a custom prompt below, so that prompt should be in the output. It also has no solution!_

_Write your thing here._

**Question 7:** What is the answer?

_Type your answer here, replacing this text._

**Question 8:** Test intercell seeding by generating 10 random $N(4,2)$ numbers.

```{r tags=c()}
z <- NULL # YOUR CODE HERE
z
```

```{r}
. = ottr::check("tests/q8.R")
```

**You're done!**

## Submission

Make sure you have run all cells in your notebook in order before running the cell below, so that all images/graphs appear in the output. The cell below will generate a zip file for you to submit. **Please save before exporting!**

```{r}
# Save your notebook first, then run this cell to export your submission.
ottr::export("rmd-example.Rmd", pdf = TRUE)
```
