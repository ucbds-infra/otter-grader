# Otter Assign for Rmd

```{r}
library(testthat)
library(ggplot2)
rng_seed <- 90
```

**Question 1.** Assign x to the smallest prime number.

```{r}
x <- ...
```

```{r}
. = ottr::check("tests/q1.R")
```

**Question 2.** Visualize the answer

```{r}
plt.plot(...);
```

This cell is not part of a question.

```{r}
y = 3
```

**Question 3.** Define `square` and assign `nine` to 3 squared.

```{r}
square = function(x) {
    y = ...
    # YOUR CODE HERE
}

nine = ...
```

```{r}
. = ottr::check("tests/q3.R")
```

**Question 4.** What does equilateral mean?

```

**Question 5.** Approximate the area and circumference of a circle with radius 3.

```{r}
pi = 3.14
if (TRUE) {
    # YOUR CODE HERE
    print(paste0('A circle with radius', radius, 'has area', area))
}

circumference = function(r) {
    # Next, define a circumference function.
}
```

```{r}
# This question has no tests.
```

**Question 6.** Write something
